Proxy Anywhere Extension
=====================================

This Google Chrome extension allows you to enter a custom proxy server to Chrome.
With a click of a button, you can switch to your custom proxy, or back to normal.

How does it work?
----------------
It uses the Google Chrome Extension API to interact with the Proxy server.
You setup your information in the options (host, port, and scheme), and once
you click on the button, it toggles the proxy status.
